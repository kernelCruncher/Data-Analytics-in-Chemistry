# Data Analytics in Chemistry

We include the Jupyter Notebook that uses the BindingDB dataset to look for candidate drug molecules and binding proteins. There are several large files that have not been included due to their size. They are `rdk_descriptors.csv`, `morgan_fingerprints.csv`, `mordred_descriptors.csv` and `BindingDB_BindingDB_Articles_202310.tsv`.
